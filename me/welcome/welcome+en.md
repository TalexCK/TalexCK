# Welcome!

Hello everyone, I am Alex Tang, a high school student, and welcome to my personal space!&#x20;

Here, I will share my life, games, projects, math learning and some achievements, and I hope to communicate and learn with you.&#x20;

I am interested in programming and math, and I also like to play some fun games, such as Minecraft and HearthStone.&#x20;

I have my own website [TalexCKsSpace](https://me.talexck.space), where you can see the projects and articles I have done, and you can also follow me on [Github](https://github.com/TalexCK) I also have accounts on [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/1368936367) and [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/talexcalexk), where you can see some videos and answers I posted.
